# Security Policy

NuciLog.Core is a lightweight logging abstraction for .NET applications. This security policy outlines how vulnerabilities are reported, investigated, and disclosed to ensure the safety and integrity of the library and its consumers.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

Use this table to indicate which project versions currently receive security maintenance.

| Preceding versions | Any distribution channel | ❌ |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not disclose suspected vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers have had an opportunity to validate and remediate them.

To report a vulnerability:
- [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/hmlendea/nucilog.core/security/advisories)
- Contact the maintainers directly

## 📌 Scope

The subsequent report categories are in scope for this repository:
- Vulnerabilities in core logging abstraction and pipeline
- Security issues in structured log data handling and sanitisation
- Vulnerabilities affecting the public API (`ILogger`, `Logger`, `LogInfo`, and related contracts)
- Exception handling and enrichment security concerns
- Sensitive data masking and protection mechanisms

The subsequent categories are out of scope unless explicitly stated to the contrary:
- Concrete logger sink implementations (owned by consumers)
- Destination-specific concerns (files, databases, external services)
- Security policies of downstream log aggregation or storage services
- Vulnerabilities in application code consuming the library
- Third-party dependencies with independent security advisories

## 📢 Disclosure Policy

This project follows coordinated disclosure:
1. Vulnerabilities are investigated privately.
2. A remediation plan is prepared and validated.
3. Public disclosure is published after a fix, mitigation, or agreed risk decision is available.
4. Credit is attributed in accordance with reporter preference and project policy.

## 🧾 Safe Harbour

If your research is conducted in good faith, confined to authorised scope, and disclosed responsibly, the maintainers will not pursue action for policy-compliant activity.

## 🙏 Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Reporters who desire public attribution may be acknowledged in release notes, advisories, or a dedicated acknowledgements section.
